            Great day as I got to see some old friends I have not seen in a while. To ensure
            <strong> COVID safety</strong>, we made sure to get tested before hanging out 
            together. We all ate some great food together and watched LCK (Korean professional League
            of Legends) which started at 1am. We are all <i>basically</i> nocturnal. One of my friends
            is a fellow kpop listener so it was always nice to catch up with him.
        </p>
        <p style = "font-size: 3ch;">
            Dodgers play the <b>Washington Nationals</b> today. This is a very important game because
            two years ago the heavily favorited Dodgers lost to the National in the NLDS in five games.
            The Nationals would go on to win <em>the World Series</em> so it would be a nice to get a 
            little bit of revenge (even if we won the World Series last year).

                <summary>Red Velvet</summary>
                <p>Red Velvet is a South Korean girl group formed by SM entertainment. Debuted in 2014, they originally had four members:
                    Irene, Seulgi, Wendy and Joy. In 2015, they added a fifth member Yeri. They're most famous songs include: Dumb Dumb,
                    Red Flavor, Bad Boy, and Psycho. They have been on an unofficial hiatus since December of 2019.
                </p>
            </details>
             <br>
            <b>Overall Opinions:</b> It was a very good album and Wendy is an amazing vocalist. Unfortunately,
            the majority of the songs were ballads which really is not the type of music that I like.
